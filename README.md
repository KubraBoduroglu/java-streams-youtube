* Imperative programming to declarative programming  
* Java Streams works really well with the Collections, its made for Collections.
* What Streams allows us to do is to simply ask what we want form our collection.

### Filter  
* Filter takes Predicate.  
* Predicate: Simply returns true or false. And this is what you want to keep from original list.
* After performing filter operation, now we have to collect the result back into a list.
